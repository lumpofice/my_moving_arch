					<p>Some companies sell their butter products by the box. Whether it be a box of 4 4oz-packages of butter, or a box of 8 2oz-packages of butter, the company sells that butter in the same size box. Conceivably, the company could sell that box as 1 16oz-package of butter or 16 1oz-packages of butter. In any event, that box represents the "space" in which 100% of the purchased butter, which has been broken down to a number of pre-sized packages, resides. A concept in mathemtics, consisting of breaking down 100% of a material contained within a given space to <em><span style="color: #d079a2">every possible</span></em> package of some pre-defined size within that space, is what we aim to tackle below. Of course, what we will ultimately be dealing with is a space of numbers, and numbers behave differently from that of butter. So, let us emphasize again the words <em><span style="color: #d079a2">every</span></em> and <em><span style="color: #d079a2">possible</span></em> within the phrase:</p>
					<p>"...breaking down 100% of a material contained within a given space to <em><span style="color: #d079a2">every possible</span></em> package of some pre-defined size within that space..."</p>
					<p>In math, we could break down a given space of numbers into every possible package of some predetermined size&mdash;and on a website, we can do the same with a box of butter. For instance, take our attempt at drawing a 3-dimensional block of butter:</p>
				</div>
				<div id='block0'>
				</div>
				<div id='topic'>
					<p>This block of butter is rectangular in shape and has 6 sides. Let us take a look directly at the short, right-facing side of this block of butter, indicated by the large <span style="color: #d079a2">R</span>&mdash;the large <span style="color: #d079a2">R</span> is not meant to indicate the longer, back-facing side of this block of butter&mdash; under two different conditions:
						<ul>
							<li>i) The block of butter is in its whole form, before breaking it down to smaller packages</li>
							<br>
							<li>ii) The block of butter has been broken down to 4 smaller packages&mdash;which many fondly refer to as "sticks"&mdash; of butter.</li>
						</ul>
