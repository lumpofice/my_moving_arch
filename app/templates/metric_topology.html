					<h1>Metric Topology</h1>

					<p>Some companies sell their butter products by the box. Whether it be a box of 4 4oz packages of butter, or a box of 8 2oz packages of butter, the company sells that butter in the same size box. Conceivably, the company could sell that box as 1 16oz block of butter or 16 1oz packages of butter; they could sell it as a combination 4 2oz and 2 4oz packages; they could sell it as a combination of 14 1oz and 1 2oz package; any sizing and numbering combination of packages. In any of these scenarios, that box represents the "space" in which 100% of the purchased butter, which has been broken down to a number of arbitrarily sized packages, resides. A concept in mathemtics, consisting of breaking down 100% of a material contained within a given space to <em><span style="color: #d079a2">every possible</span></em> package of some arbitrary size within that space, is what we aim to tackle below. Of course, what we will ultimately be dealing with is a space of numbers, but we can begin to think about this concept using something maleable like butter.</p> 
					<p>Let's emphasize again the words <em><span style="color: #d079a2">every</span></em> and <em><span style="color: #d079a2">possible</span></em> within the phrase:</p>
					<p>"...breaking down 100% of a material contained within a given space to <em><span style="color: #d079a2">every possible</span></em> package of some arbitrary size within that space..."</p>
					<p>Take our attempt at drawing a 3-dimensional block of butter:</p>
				</div>
				<div id='block0'>
				</div>
				<div id='topic'>
					<p>This block of butter is rectangular in shape and has 6 sides. Taking a look directly at the short, right-facing side of this block of butter, indicated by the large <span style="color: #d079a2">R</span>&mdash;the large <span style="color: #d079a2">R</span> is not meant to indicate the longer, back-facing side of this block of butter&mdash; under two different conditions:
						<ul>
							<li>i) the block of butter is in its whole form, before breaking it down to smaller packages</li>
							<br>
							<li>ii) the block of butter has been broken down to 4 smaller packages&mdash;which many fondly refer to as "sticks"&mdash; of butter.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id='block1'>
				</div>
				<div id='block2'>
				</div>
				<div id='topic'>
					<button id='center_point'>Show Center Points</button>
				</div>
				<div id='topic'>
					<p>we can see that each face&mdash;each face of a block or stick of butter extending out of view and into our screen&mdash;has a center. The centers of any of the arbitrarily sized packages within the larger space will be important later as we dive deeper into the concept. For now, let us be content with the fact that the centers exist, and let's click the button below to show these points so that we may free up some bandwidth between our ears.</p>
					<p>Breaking down 100% of the butter contained within its box to <em><span style="color: #d079a2">every possible</span></em> stick of butter of some arbitrary size, to some degree of precision via technology, is possible. Of course, the naked eye cannot keep up with the technology, but here are two examples of what possibilities lie within such technological reaches</p>

				<div id='block3'>
				</div>
				<div id='block4'>
				</div>
				<div id='topic'>
					<p>This is only 2 of uncountably infinite possibilities; the task of drawing every possiblility is impossible; as technology outpaces our naked eye, mathematics outpaces our technology! Given this, let's leave the butter sticks alone for the moment&mdash;much of what we do next does not make practical sense; spaces of numbers are too perfect and precise to be considered practical, anyway&mdash;and simply focus on these 2-dimensional drawings as we take a deeper dive into this concept. Currently, our "space"&mdash;box&mdash;of material has been broken down to several smaller "subsets"&mdash;packages&mdash;of multiple fixed sizes, with each subset being contained within the larger space. But is our space broken down to <em><span style="color: #d079a2">every possible</span></em> subset of some arbitrary size? Would you agree that we could draw other subsets of different sizes anywhere within our larger space, even if there is overlap between them and the already existing subsets?</p>
